# **What** is the SmartPlanner application
The `SmartPlanner` application is intended to assist the user to organize and follow in an effective and scientific manner his learning or studying tasks, as well as his general or daily life tasks.\
The user can elaborate a schedule (a studying schedule, or simply a normal schedule for general tasks). <br>
The user can :
- Create a schedule, and follow the schedule progress, statistics and other information
- Add personal notes while running tasks
- At the end of the schedule, elaborate a summary, by aggregating the notes or by writing a summary from scratch.
- Pause the schedule for a given period, and resume it later on
- Filter the list of displayed schedules, based on schedules tags and/or status

There are 2 types of schedules:
- Study schedules: for study, learning or reading tasks
- Agenda schedules: general or daily life schedules (e.g. sport workout, personal tasks...etc)

# **How** to use the SmartPlanner application
### Create the schedule or planning
To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:
- The schedule title (e.g. for study or reading schedules, the book title for example)
- The desired start date of the schedule
- The schedule time slots and their repeat mode
- At least a tag representing the general topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature, Arts...etc)

And for study or reading schedules, the following info:
- The number of pages of the book or the reading support (*)
- The average reading time for a single page (*)

(*) These parameters are used to have an approximation of the total required study or reading time of the book.

Below is an illustration of the schedule creation form:

### Schedules view
The schedules view contains the list of created schedules (Study and agenda (normal) schedules)
The list contains schedules headers with brief important information about the schedule (title, start date, repeat mode, tags...etc).

- `Accomplished time`: the time that was consumed during the schedule runs. For study schedules, if the schedule is restarted, ths achieved time is reset to `0` and a new achievement is added.
- `Runs`: The number of times the schedule was run (a run is triggered using the `Run Task` in the schedule details view.
- `Notes`: How many notes were creaated in the schedule

For study schedules, the statistics contains also the following data:
- `Progress`: The study progress, or percentage of the study accomplishment (based on the achieved time and the calculated reading time)
