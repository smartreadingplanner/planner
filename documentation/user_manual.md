# **What** is the SmartPlanner application
The `SmartPlanner` application is intended to help the user to organize and plan his learning or reading tasks.\
The user can elaborate a reading or learning schedule around a book or a reading support in general (book, reading paper...etc). He can then:
- Start the reading schedule, and follow the schedule progress and the expected schedule end date
- Add personal reading notes while reading
- At the end of the reading schedule, elaborate a schedule summary, by aggregating the notes or by writing a summary from scratch.
- Pause the schedule for a given period, and resume it later on
- Filter the list of displayed schedules, based on schedules tags and/or status

# **How** to use the SmartPlanner application
### Create the schedule or planning
To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:
- The schedule title (e.g. simply the book title)
- The number of pages in the book (*)
- The average reading time for a single page (*)
- The desired start and end dates of the schedule
- At least a tag representing the general topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature...etc)
- And finally the dedicated weekly time slots for the schedule

(*) These data are used to have an approximation of the total reading time of the book.

> - After the schedule creation, and also all along the schedule progress, the application gives the user an approximation about the ***expected end date*** of the reading schedule.

> - The application will notify you before the schedule tasks. Please ensure that the **notifications are allowed** on your device for the `SmartPlanner` application.

> - The application will ask you to allow notifications when needed.

### Run your schedule
1. Upon notification reception, or if you want to run the schedule outside the dedicated time slots, go to the schedule details view and click on the `Run Task` **before starting your reading**
