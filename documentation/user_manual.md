# **What** is the SmartPlanner application
The `SmartPlanner` application is intended to assist the user to organize and follow in an effective and scientific manner his learning or studying tasks, as well as his general or daily life tasks.\
The user can elaborate a schedule (a studying schedule, or simply a normal schedule for general tasks). <br>
The user can :
- Create a schedule, and follow the schedule progress, statistics and other information
- Add personal notes while running tasks
- At the end of the schedule, elaborate a summary, by aggregating the notes or by writing a summary from scratch.
- Pause the schedule for a given period, and resume it later on
- Filter the list of displayed schedules, based on schedules tags and/or status
- Share notes, summaries or schedule statistics online with other users

There are 2 types of schedules:
- Study schedules: for study, learning or reading tasks
- Agenda schedules: general or daily life schedules (e.g. sport workout, personal tasks...etc)

The main functions are illustrated below:

# **How** to use the SmartPlanner application
### Create the schedule or planning
To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:
- The schedule title (e.g. for study or reading schedules, the book title for example)
- The desired start date of the schedule
- The schedule time slots and their repeat mode
- At least a tag representing the general topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature, Arts...etc)

And for study or reading schedules, the following info:
- The number of pages of the book or the reading support (*)
- The average reading time for a single page (*)

(*) These parameters are used to have an approximation of the total required study or reading time of the book.

Below is an illustration of the schedule creation form:

> To get notified about the schedule coming tasks:
> -  Please add notifications to the schedule.
> -  Please also ensure that the **notifications are allowed** on your device for the `SmartPlanner` application.

### Schedules view
The schedules view contains the list of created schedules (Study and agenda (normal) schedules)
The list contains schedules headers with brief important information about the schedule (title, start date, repeat mode, tags...etc).

> For study schedules also, the study progress is indicated in the schedule header.

- `Accomplished time`: the time that was consumed during the schedule runs. For study schedules, if the schedule is restarted, ths achieved time is reset to `0` and a new achievement is added.
- `Runs`: The number of times the schedule was run (a run is triggered using the `Run Task` in the schedule details view.
- `Notes`: How many notes were creaated in the schedule

For study schedules, the statistics contains also the following data:
- `Progress`: The study progress, or percentage of the study accomplishment (based on the achieved time and the calculated reading time)

# Cloud content

You can share your content (notes, summaries and statistics) with other users online. You can get also content matching your respective schedules (match by tags ou keywords).

<img src="https://github.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/blob/release/cloud/documentation/display/cloud_workflow.png" width="200">

### How content is shared
When you share a content (note, summary or schedule status) online, it is shared with the following metadata:
- The tags of the schedule to wich the content belongs
- The keywords of the schedule to wich the content belongs
- The sharing context, which is the groups with which to share privately the content with.
  No groups means that the content is shared publicly with all users. If some groups are specified, only these groups members can access the shared content.

Once, you can update or delete the content on the cloud.

#### Sharing notes and summaries
In the notes view, and summary view, you have the menu to share the content on the cloud. Below an illustration example for sharing a note online.

_Task note menu:_ <br><br>

_Sharing a note privately within a group:_ <br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/blob/release/cloud/documentation/display/cloud/cloud_sharing_status_private.png" width="200">

#### Sharing schedule's status
The schedule's status can only shared within groups. It can not be shared publicly with all users.

### Real time fetched content for schedules
For each schedule, cloud content is fetched automatically on real time. The content is fetched based on the schedule tags and keywords.

_Notifications about new cloud content:_ <br><br>

_Cloud matching content for a given schedule:_ <br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/blob/release/cloud/documentation/display/cloud/schedules_new_cloud_content.png" width="200">

### Cloud groups
Every user can create a group on the cloud. Other users online can then join this group.
The group members can then share content privately (content accessible only for group members) within the group.

_Cloud groups:_ <br><br>

_Cloud group content:_ <br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/smartreadingplanner/smartplanner/blob/release/cloud/documentation/display/cloud/cloud_group_content.png" width="200">

The group owner can manage the group settings. Accept or decline users requests to join the group. Or delete members from the group.
