- Add his personal reading notes while reading
- At the end os the reading schedule, elaborate a schedule summary, by aggregating the notes or by writing a summary from scratch.
- Pause the schedule for a given period, and resume it later on
- Filter the list of displayed schedules, based on these schedules tags or/and status
