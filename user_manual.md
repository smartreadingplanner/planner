# **What** is the SmartPlanner application
The `SmartPlanner` application is intended to help the user to organize and plan his learning or reading tasks.\
The user can elaborate a reading or learning schedule around a book or a reading support in general (book, reading paper...etc). He can then:
- Start the reading schedule, and follow his reading progress and expected schedule end
- Add his personal reading notes while reading
- At the end os the reading schedule, elaborate a schedule summary, by aggregating the notes or by writing a summary from scratch.
- Pause the schedule for a given period, and resume it later on
- Filter the list of displayed schedules, based on these schedules tags or/and status

# **How** to use the SmartPlanner application
### Create the schedule or planning
To create a schedule (or planning), you should provide:\
- The schedule title (e.g. simply the book title)
- The number of pages in the book (*)
- The average reading time for a single page (*)
- The desired start and end dates of the schedule
- At least a tag representing the general topic of the schedule (e.g. Economy, Literature...etc)
- And finally the dedicated weekly time slots for the schedule

(*) These data is used to have an approximation of the total reading time of the book.

> - After the schedule creation, and also all along the schedule progress, the application gives the user an approximation about the ***expected end date*** of the reading schedule.\
> - The application will notify you before the schedule tasks. Please ensure that the **notifications are allowed** on your device for the `SmartPlanner` application.\
> - The application will ask you to allow notifications when needed.

### Run your schedule
1. Upon notification reception, or if you want to run the schedule outside the dedicated time slots, go to the schedule details view and click on the `Run Task` **before starting your reading**
2. While running your reading task, you have the possibility to add your personal notes. You can share these notes with other people.
3. You can also pause the task at any time to have a break, and resume it later on.
4. **Once you have finished your reading, please to click** on the `End Task` button. This is mandatory so your reading time is taken into account in the schedule, and your notes are saved.

# Further functionalities

For each schedule, you can create a summary. You can build the summary by aggregating the schedule tasks notes, or you can create a summary from scratch.
These summaries can be shared by other people.

Paused schedules will have their notifications suspended during the pause period.

### Tags
